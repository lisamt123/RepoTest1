Kristen Kalnasi came to VinSolutions after working only 5 years in the retail automotive industry, but she was successfully recognized and provided the opportunity to wear many hats during that time. From the internet department to office manager and on to F&amp;I, she was able to quickly learn the ins and outs of the dealership by handling phone calls, test drives, title work, warranties, accounts payable and receivable, fleet sales, dealer trades, and closing and selling back-end products for 4 rooftops. She later joined the Van Tuyl organization and attended their F&amp;I school, which continued her role as a producer for their Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Subaru stores. Today she serves as your VinPro to make sure your needs are met and desires are heard.





Sincerely,


Kristen Kalnasi
