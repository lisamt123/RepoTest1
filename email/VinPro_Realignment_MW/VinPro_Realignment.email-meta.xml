    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},



As you’re aware, VinSolutions is growing rapidly and in an effort to enhance your customer service experience, we are expanding the VinPro team in your region. This expansion of the VinPro department will improve our efforts to provide consistent and effective customer service. Obviously by dividing the workload, this allows your assigned VinPro to be more readily available to address your needs. Moving forward, if your assigned VinPro is unavailable; you may contact the other VinPro in your region to get immediate assistance.




We would like to introduce your newly assigned VinPro, Danny Pinon.

Many years in the finance department as a closer, producer, director, and sub-prime specialist, very knowledgeable with the used car market, clocking many hours at the auctions as a buyer. Most recently as an independent dealer.
