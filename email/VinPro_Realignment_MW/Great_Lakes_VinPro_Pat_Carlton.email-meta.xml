    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},



As you’re aware, VinSolutions is growing rapidly and in an effort to enhance your customer service experience, we are expanding the VinPro team in your region. This expansion of the VinPro department will improve our efforts to provide consistent and effective customer service. Obviously by dividing the workload, this allows your assigned VinPro to be more readily available to address your needs. Moving forward, if your assigned VinPro is unavailable; you may contact the other VinPro in your region to get immediate assistance.


We would like to introduce your newly assigned VinPro, Patrick Carlton.





Patrick Carlton I have been involved in project management for the construction industry for the last eleven years. Prior to that I worked in sales with Mercedes and Acura for a little over five years. I am here to help Dealerships utilizing our products become and stay efficient / productive. This in turn will add to the “Bottom Line” and provide a less stressful work environment for them. I am very serious about our customers and their experience with our company and will make every effort to ensure I am an asset to them.  I am a single dad of an amazing little girl, Lillie and she makes me very proud!  We live in Kansas City with our two very large dogs, Alley and Bear.

Bobby Holmes I have been a key player in our VinSolutions support “VinCare” department for some time.  My in-depth knowledge of the system, many years of experience in support, account management and sales allows me to be a valued asset to your dealership and dealership’s personal.
