Franklin, TN
 Tuesday, April 14, 2015

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}, 

You are cordially invited to join us on Tuesday, April 14 in Franklin, TN when Darrel Ferguson, Senior Performance Manager at vAuto, will conduct a Provisioning Workshop.

This workshop is complimentary to all vAuto customers and is recommended for General Managers, Sales Managers, and Buyers.

Workshop Overview:
 A “hands on” introduction to Provision’s stocking tool, which can help solve dealers’ biggest challenge: sourcing inventory. 

Using your own device (laptop/tablet), Darrel will lead you through the Provision stocking tool in its entirety: from set-up to vehicle acquisition. You will be given opportunities throughout the session to apply what you’ve learned in your own dealership’s Provision application. In this session, Darrel will also include best practice sourcing techniques, Advanced Workbench, and AuctionGenius.

Workshop Objectives:
 - Define your dealership stocking strategy &amp; objectives
 - Ensure the settings for the Provision stocking tool are set up optimally for your dealership
 - Learn to use vAuto’s unique grading system to identify vehicles that fit your dealership&apos;s stocking objectives
 - Create a list of vehicles for purchase

What to Bring:
 - Your laptop or other device that you use to access vAuto’s Provision tool (not required, but highly recommended. WiFi will be provided)
