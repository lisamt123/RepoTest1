Dealers like to keep it simple with their new car pricing. Many just leave every car at MSRP. Some apply a standard discount of $500 to $1,000, depending on model. A few opt for intrigue, asking buyers to “call for details.”



Trouble is, dealers often don’t recognize that these pricing approaches turn today’s buyers into adversaries. In the process, dealers put their gross profits at risk.



But some choose a different, more transparent path. They use competitive market data to identify each vehicle’s optimal price position, given its equipment, trim and available incentives. Here’s what happens:






•
32 percent more new car VDPs


•
Increased front-end gross, with some dealers seeing an average of $400 more per car


•
Average days to sale drops by four days
