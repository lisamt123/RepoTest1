    <subject>Stop Giving Up Gross In Your New Cars</subject>
    <textOnly>After dealer Jim Blickle of Performance Toyota, Sinking Spring, PA, started using Conquest he made a discovery.



For some new vehicles, he’d been giving up gross profit as he used his own formula to determine asking prices.



“My prices were half-decent for what I came up with, but they weren’t anywhere near as dialed in as they are today with Conquest,” Blickle says. “With Conquest, I’m now able to see the market and identify opportunities to raise my prices. Our gross is up about $400 a car.”



Blickle isn’t alone. Other Conquest dealers say the system’s real-time, vehicle-specific market intelligence gives them a competitive edge that lifts gross profits, improves sales volumes and helps them earn floorplan credits by turning inventory more quickly.



With Conquest, you can instantly find the market sweet spot for every new vehicle in your inventory.



See how Conquest can help your dealership win the new way in new vehicles, and stop giving up gross profit for good.
