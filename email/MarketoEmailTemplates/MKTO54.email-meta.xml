    <subject>Market-Based Pricing Helps Dealers Attract New Vehicle Buyers</subject>
    <textOnly>Dealers using vAuto’s Conquest new vehicle inventory management and pricing system saw a 32 percent increase in the Vehicle Details Page (VDP) views for their new vehicle listings, according to a joint vAuto/AutoTrader study.



The reason? Conquest gives dealers the ability to price and merchandise their new vehicles to the market, which means more attention from potential buyers. Even better, Conquest dealers are making more money when they retail new vehicles, thanks to more market-transparent pricing and sales processes.



Conquest also tells dealers the exact new cars and configurations that sell best, helping them align their inventories to current demand.



For Conquest dealers, the cycle of getting the right cars and retailing them quickly at higher front-end margins continues.



How is your new vehicle pricing and merchandising strategy working for you?
