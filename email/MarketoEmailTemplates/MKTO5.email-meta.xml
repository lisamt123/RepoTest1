    <subject>Looking Forward To Your vAuto Conquest Demo at NADA 2015</subject>
    <textOnly>Thank you for scheduling your vAuto Conquest demo at NADA (booth #1718S) and the opportunity to improve your new vehicle sales performance. I’m confident Conquest can help improve your new vehicle sales and profitability.



When you arrive at the booth (#1718S), ask for me or look for my “I’m Kim” button. I’ll connect you with a Product Specialist and give you a free spin on our Prize Wheel once the demo’s complete.



Safe travels to San Francisco. If you have any questions or can’t make your appointment, call me directly at 815-341-1230.



Thank you again. The vAuto team and I look forward to seeing you at NADA!



Sincerely,







Associate Manager, Marketing
