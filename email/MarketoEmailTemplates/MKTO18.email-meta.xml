    <subject>Help vAuto Serve You Better</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}}:

Although vAuto is widely known and respected for very good service and support, I want you to know that we are never satisfied. 

In fact, itâ€™s critically important to me and to our entire team, that we constantly discover our weaknesses and find ways to improve our service. To this end, I&apos;ve commissioned an independent outside company to survey you and I&apos;m requesting a few minutes of your time to provide us with the most honest and candid feedback. I would especially encourage you to be tough on us and provide us with the most critical feedback possible. This will give us the best opportunity to improve upon the services we provide. Also, please know that your name will be kept completely anonymous to all of us at vAuto. The details of what will be coming are below.

Tomorrow you will receive an invitation from CEB Customer Surveys to participate in an online evaluation of your recent vAuto experience and the service we provided you. The evaluation takes less than 10 minutes to complete, and you can stop it and restart at a later time if necessary.

Thank you in advance for your help.
Best regards,
Dale
