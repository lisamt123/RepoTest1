    <subject>You Can’t Win In Used Cars If You Don’t Win At Auctions</subject>
    <textOnly>Many dealers believe there’s a shortage of used cars—or at least a shortage of the right cars at the right prices.



But how can there be a shortage if the lanes are full of cars? Could the problem be your buyers lack the skills and tools to work the run lists and lanes to find the cars you need?



A growing number of dealers have realized the auction game has changed. They no longer show up on the day of an auction and start scanning cars. They come ready. They know the cars they want. They know what they’ll pay—and they can assess any last-minute arrivals in seconds.



These buyers and dealers use AuctionGenius, a game-changing tool that lets you quickly segment and sort run lists to identify cars that fit your inventory criteria. Whether you’re at the auction or online, AuctionGenius tells you when the cars you want are running, letting you work multiple lanes and bids at the same time.
