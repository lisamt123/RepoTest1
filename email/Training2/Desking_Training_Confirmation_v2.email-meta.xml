    <textOnly>Dear {!Training__c.Training_Contact__c},

This email is a confirmation of our scheduled appointment for additional training on our new VinConnect Desking module.

Scheduled Training Time: {!Training__c.Scheduled_Training_Time__c}
Assigned VS Trainer: {!Training__c.Assigned_Trainer__c}

We will have your trainer reach out to you by phone 10 minutes before your scheduled time to ensure everything is set up for a timely start.

As a reminder, the trainer will be using the website www.join.me to share their screen with your team.

Instructions for www.join.me are as follows:
· Go to the website www.join.me
· On the homepage you will see “Join Meeting”
· The trainer will provide you the access code to join his/her meeting

We have blocked off 2 hours to spend with your team; however, it will be split into two 45-minute sessions.  Much like your original training, our goal is to ensure that every team member receives proper training without removing your entire staff from the Showroom floor.

TOPIC: Finalize Desking Settings 
ATTENDEES: CRM Admin &amp; Top Management 
TIME: 30 Minutes 

TOPIC: VinConnect Desking Training: Session #1 
ATTENDEES: Desk Managers: Group 1 
TIME: 45 minutes 

TOPIC: VinConnect Desking Training: Session #2 
ATTENDEES: Desk Managers: Group 2 
TIME: 45 minutes 

Because this is focused on the Desking module, only your Managers (or anyone that will be desking deals) should be in attendance.

As mentioned during our conversation, our goal with this initiative is to sunset our Legacy desking tool, and transition all of our dealers to the new, and improved, VinConnect Desking.

If you have any additional questions or have to reschedule for any reason, please feel free reach out to me.  My contact information is below.

Thank you for your participation, we look forward to sitting down with you and your team!
