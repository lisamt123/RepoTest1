    <subject>What are you doing for 4th of July?</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},

What are you doing for your Fourth of July campaign this year? In the last 12 months, VinSolutions&apos; campaigns have returned an average of 12.14 to 1 ROI for our dealers. Let us drive your campaign and increase transition rates.

Your database shows {!Account.00N70000002sJZ3} customers with a mailing address and {!Account.00N70000002sJYt} customers with an email address. What about the {!Account.00N70000002sKy9} service customers that have never bought a car from you? As your Marketing Retention Manager, I can help you uncover these types of hidden opportunities.

To ensure timely delivery, orders must be placed before June 13.
