    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

VinSolutions values your feedback and realizes that most of our enhancements are driven by our user community. Unfortunately, we are unable to fulfill every feature request we receive, but all requests are logged and evaluated at future intervals, even ones that we are unable to complete initially. Our product management team reviews these monthly and meets with our Development staff to evaluate growing customer needs and coordinate product enhancements into our regular release cycle.

Although we are unable to complete your feature request at this time, it has been and will remain in our system for future evaluation.

Thank you for your valued feedback!

Sincerely,
Your VinSolutions Support and VinPro Teams
