Adam Juarez I have been in the auto industry for over 7 years as both salesman and Internet Manager.  In addition to sales I was responsible for maintaining and updating the dealership website and working with 3rd party vendors to maximize exposure and ROI.  I also have a degree in Network Systems Administration from DeVry University.  The combination of my experience in both sales and technical service allows me to support all aspects of a dealerâ€™s needs in relation to their Internet presence.  I have been married for 10 years and have a son and daughter.  My free time is usually spent playing or listening to music and playing sports with my family.

Sincerely,

Adam Juarez
