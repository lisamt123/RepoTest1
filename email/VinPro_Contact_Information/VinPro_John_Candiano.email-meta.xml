    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

As you’re aware, VinSolutions is growing rapidly and in an effort to enhance your customer service experience, we are expanding the VinPro team in your region. This expansion of the VinPro department will improve our efforts to provide consistent and effective customer service. Obviously by dividing the workload, this allows your assigned VinPro to be more readily available to address your needs. Moving forward, if your assigned VinPro is unavailable; you may contact the other VinPro in your region to get immediate assistance.

We would like to introduce your newly assigned VinPro, John Candiano.

John Candiano

I&apos;m a 2nd generation automotive professional, following my father who spent 38 years in automotive retail.  I&apos;ve been in automotive retail since 1998 working as a Finance and/or Sales Manager for some of the city’s top domestic dealerships.  I also worked as an Account Manager for US Bank and First National Bank of Kansas, servicing Kansas &amp; Missouri dealers.  Top notch customer service has always been my primary focus and look forward to bringing that experience to our dealer clients.

Erin Morse I grew up in a car family and no matter how much I try, I can’t get it out of my blood!  I worked in our family dealership from the time I could walk.  After graduating from the University of Texas, I worked my way up the ranks of Enterprise Rent-A-Car in Southern California.  From there I managed several travel agencies, and ventured into the account management side of the business.   I have worked for Richard Petty Driving Experience, and for Kansas Speedway, I love all things automotive!  Growing up with a family-owned dealership, I understand how important the customer is to your business, and can show there is no better tool for retaining them, than VinSolutions!
