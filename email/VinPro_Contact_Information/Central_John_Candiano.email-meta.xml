    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

VinSolutions is growing rapidly and in an effort to enhance your customer service experience, we are expanding the VinPro team in your region. This expansion of the VinPro department will improve our efforts to provide consistent and effective customer service. Obviously by dividing the workload, this allows me to be more readily available to address your needs.

I&apos;m a 2nd generation automotive professional, following my father who spent 38 years in automotive retail.  I&apos;ve been in automotive retail since 1998 working as a Finance and/or Sales Manager for some of the cityâ€™s top domestic dealerships.  I also worked as an Account Manager for US Bank and First National Bank of Kansas, servicing Kansas &amp; Missouri dealers.  Top notch customer service has always been my primary focus and look forward to bringing that experience to our dealer clients.
