    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Our records indicate you have registered for one of our Manager Level Virtual Training classes. However, in checking your account, it appears as though your User ID is not set up with Manager level access. Therefore, you are ineligible to attend any classes requiring this level of access.

If you are a manager and your access level has been set up incorrectly and needs to be updated, please see your dealership Admin to have your access level changed. Otherwise, please review our list of Virtual Training classes and register for classes that are specifically designed for your level of access.

Please feel free to reach out to our Virtual Training Team.
