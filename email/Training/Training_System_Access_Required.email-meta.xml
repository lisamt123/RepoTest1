    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Our records indicate you have registered for one of our Virtual Training class. However, in checking your account, it appears as though you have not been set up as a user in the system yet. Unfortunately, without a VinSolutions login you are ineligible to take any of our Virtual Training classes.

If you are a user in the system, please provide me with your dealership name, VinSolutions account number and your VinSolutions User ID. If you do not have a VinSolutions User ID, please contact your dealership Admin to be set up with a User ID. Once this is done, you will be able to take classes appropriate for your user level access.

If you would like to see a demo of our product, please contact our Sales Department at (913)825-6124, and they will be happy to accommodate your needs.

Please feel free to reach out to our Virtual Training Team.
