    <textOnly>Greetings {!Contact.FirstName}, My name is Devin Blair and I am excited and honored to be your VinPro, key point of contact, here at Vin Solutions.

Let me start by telling you a bit about myself: I have been with Vin Solutions for about a year now and many of you might have talked to me in the past in any particular Virtual Training session if you ever signed up or experienced this training.  I have recently taken the jump into the role of VinPro, but due to my previous duties within the company, I have a solid foundation in system knowledge and certainly would be happy to train and assist you with any system issues that you might encounter.

My daily goal is to be available for your dealership starting today and to ensure that our system will optimize your performance, maximize efficiency and ensure your bottom line.  To better assist I would like to conduct any training that you might require via Webex in order to provide you with a hands on understanding of the system.

I look forward to hearing and getting to know you in the future and you can find my contact information below.

At any point in time, don&apos;t hesitate to call or email you as I would be happy to introduce myself and assist with any needs or concerns that you may have.


Respectfully,
Devin Blair</textOnly>
