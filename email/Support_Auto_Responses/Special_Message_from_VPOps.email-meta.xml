    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName},
The notice you received that the Reynolds and Reynolds interface issue has been resolved was sent in error, although many dealers have been successfully upgraded to the new RCI interface, we are aware there are several dealers still waiting to be upgraded.  

Teams at VinSolutions and Reynolds and Reynolds are working diligently to get Dealers upgraded by close of business today.
Respectfully,

Jim NelsonVP of Operations </textOnly>
