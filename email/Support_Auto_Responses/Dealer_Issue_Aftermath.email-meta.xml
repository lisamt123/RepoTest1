We are aware of the reduction in performance that you are experiencing today. The issue has been identified, and corrective measures have been taken, which should allow for regular utilization of the system for the rest of the day. 

We will send notification when the full corrective actions have been deployed. 

We appreciate your patience. Thank you for choosing VinSolutions.
