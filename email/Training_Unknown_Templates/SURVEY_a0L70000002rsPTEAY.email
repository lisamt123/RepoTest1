Hello,

I noticed that you registered for the same class twice today. Spaces are limited and we want to make sure plenty of clients have the opportunity to take classes. I kept you enrolled in the earlier class. NAME THE CLASS. 

In the future make sure to read the course names and descriptions so you don’t register for the same class twice. If you accidentally register for a class you can cancel an enrollment. If you have any questions about this or other training matters please let me know and I’ll be happy to answer your questions.
