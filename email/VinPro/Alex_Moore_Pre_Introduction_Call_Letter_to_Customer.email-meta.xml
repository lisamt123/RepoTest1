Aaron Scheidt I worked as a service writer for two years and moved into the transportation industry and sold shuttle buses and school buses for 7 years. I also have 9 years of experience in the automotive industry both in service and sales, which gives me a good understanding of the day-to-day life at a dealership and their needs. I have been with VinSolutions for 8 months, starting as a virtual trainer and then becoming a VinPro. My experiences have helped me succeed in my position as a VinPro.

Sincerely,
Aaron Scheidt
