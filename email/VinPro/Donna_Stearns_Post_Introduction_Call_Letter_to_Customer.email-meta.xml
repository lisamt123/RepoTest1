Donna Stearns  I have been in the car business now for about 7 years. I started out working at Adams Chevrolet-a little country town dealership-and sold about 12-18 cars a month.  I enjoyed it and loved the customers but hated the hours.  One day  a manager that I had worked with at Adams called me up and said he wanted me to come interview for this job. I have now been a member of the VinSolutions family for four years. During my employment with Vin, I have worked in Support, the  Virtual Training dept., in sales as a  DDM, then I went back to support as an Account Manager, and then a Dealer Advocate-which they are now referring to as a VinPro.  I handle all the Northeast customers and I am looking forward to working with you!

Sincerely,

Donna Stearns
