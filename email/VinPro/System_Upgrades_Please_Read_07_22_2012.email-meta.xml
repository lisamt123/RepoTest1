VinSolutions will be migrating to a new and upgraded data center this coming Sunday (7/22/2012).  As a result, we are scheduling a window of downtime effective Sunday (7/22/2012) from midnight CST until 8 AM CST.

During this time we will be receiving leads but will be unable to process submitted leads during this time.  All OEMs and 3rd parties have been notified about this maintenance window.

Dealer websites will be unaffected by this scheduled maintenance.

In addition, we are adding new servers to our data center so if you have any IP filtering rules please ADD these to those rules (do not remove).

The following IP range:  50.59.43.0/24

If you have any questions please contact the Support Team.

Thanks,
Jim Nelson
