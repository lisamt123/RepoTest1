Alex Moore Prior to my employment with VIN, I spent 10 years selling cars in the dealership spending most of that time as an Internet sales manager. The last store I worked at, I ran an Internet department at a Honda, Toyota and Nissan store where I also attended F&amp;I school with the Universal Underwriters Group. This allowed me to run all the Internet sales through the finance office as well.  When I had the opportunity to first come to VinSolutions in 2007, I started by making outbound calls and setting up the online presentations for dealers to take a look at VIN. A few months later I moved on to doing the online presentations and as the company grew, I was presented the opportunity to travel to the dealerships to train the dealers on best practices and how to use our software. A few months later I had the opportunity to join the support team which is where I have spent almost the last 2.5 years as a VinPro.

Sincerely,
Alexander Moore
