    <subject>Integration with LotVantage brings dealers value</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name}:

In keeping with VinSolutions’ commitment to developing best-in-class CRM functionality and integrations, we are pleased to announce our recent integration with LotVantage.  Your store has been identified as a VinSolutions client currently using our eBay and/or Craigslist posting tools.  We’re thrilled to offer you enhanced functionality with LotVantage, at no additional base cost.

If you currently use our eBay posting tool, we will provide the eBay functions at no charge (eBay’s fees are, of course, additional).  Similarly, if you’re currently using Craigslist posting tool, we will waive the fee for LotVantage’s manual Craigslist integration but you will be responsible for Craigslist’s usage fees.

The LotVantage integration will be available in a limited release beginning May 15th, 2014.  Please contact your Performance Manager to arrange a date on which this integration may be enabled for your store and for a full demonstration of LotVantage.

Best regards,

Jennifer Lee
Vice President of Product
VinSolutions CRM and Haystak Websites</textOnly>
