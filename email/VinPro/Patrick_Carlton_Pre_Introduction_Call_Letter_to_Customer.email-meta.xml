Patrick Carlton I have been involved in project management for the construction industry for the last eleven years. Prior to that I worked in sales with Mercedes and Acura for a little over five years. I am here to help Dealerships utilizing our products become and stay efficient / productive. This in turn will add to the “Bottom Line” and provide a less stressful work environment for them. I am very serious about our customers and their experience with our company and will make every effort to ensure I am an asset to them.  I am a single dad of an amazing little girl, Lillie and she makes me very proud!  We live in Kansas City with our two very large dogs, Alley and Bear.

Sincerely,

Patrick Carlton
