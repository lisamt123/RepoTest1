    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

In response to our recently announced migration /upgrade to a new data center, VinSolutions would like to invite you to participate in the initial beta test on Sunday 07/22/12 from 6am-730am CST.  We recognize this is a small window in which to perform this initial test, however; we greatly look forward to the involvement and feedback of our DAB members during this time.  If you choose to participate, and are able to find any issues with the day-to-day functionality of the system; please contact your assigned VinPro.  If your VinPro is unavailable, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me directly.  We look to compile all of your feedback by 7:30am CST, so we can then route that feedback to the appropriate staff members for immediate attention.

Our Support department will also be available on Sunday from 8am-12pm CST.
