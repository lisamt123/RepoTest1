Erin Morse I grew up in a car family and no matter how much I try, I canâ€™t get it out of my blood!  I worked in our family dealership from the time I could walk.  After graduating from the University of Texas, I worked my way up the ranks of Enterprise Rent-A-Car in Southern California.  From there I managed several travel agencies, and ventured into the account management side of the business.   I have worked for Richard Petty Driving Experience, and for Kansas Speedway, I love all things automotive!  Growing up with a family-owned dealership, I understand how important the customer is to your business, and can show there is no better tool for retaining them, than VinSolutions!

Sincerely,

Erin Morse
