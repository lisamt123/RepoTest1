Greg Burnett I have been a VinPro with VinSolutions since August of 2011.  Prior to that I was in the car business for  six years and during that time I have worked in Sales, Business Development, and as a part of an Internet Department.  Over those six years I have developed a solid understanding of the way a dealership works.  My ambition is to leverage that experience along with my knowledge of our products to help my dealers get the most from VinSolutions.

Sincerely,
Greg Burnett
