    <subject>VinSolutions would like to announce Bobby Holmes as your new Dealer Advocate</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},
My name is Bobby Holmes and effective immediately, I will be
your new Dealer Advocate (VinPro) at VinSolutions. Pat Ecord has done an
excellent job handling your account and I assure you that I will do the same.
Pat has accepted a new position in the VinSolutions Development
Department.  We are excited for Pat and
this is a well deserved move.  He will
take with him, the experience from support and assisting all of you to our
Development team, which can only yield great things for you and VinSolutions.

 

Let me start by letting you know a little bit about me.  I have been a key player in our VinSolutions
support “VinCare” department for some time and have worked with many of you in
the past.  My in-depth knowledge of the
system, many years of experience in support, account management and sales
allows me to be a valued asset to your dealership and dealership’s
personal.  I enjoy digging in to the
system, fixing issues and passing on my knowledge to others.

 

I would like to coordinate your support efforts, and assume
the position as your primary point of contact on behalf of VinCare.  

 

I will continue with your account as long as you are a
client.  It’s my ambition to be an asset to you and your team as you make
this transition, and as long as you are a client.

 

My daily goal is to be available to your group for special
concerns or questions.  As I generally
conduct calls of an hour or more with dealership account Admins and Managers, I
may not be as readily available as our regular VinCare team.  So please
assist me by directing the bulk of your staff and their concerns to our VinCare
department.   

 

VinCare offers three options for assisting your staff with issues
including, but not limited to: user administration, process editing, lead
settings and distributions are welcome through any of these mediums.

 

•E-mail

Email your questions and issues to
Vincare.  Email address for support@vinsolutions.com

 

•Live Chat

Our VinCare team handles your live
chat issues, which can be accessed by clicking the “support” link in the upper
right corner of Motosnap. 

 

•Phone

VinCare is available during the day
(Monday thru Saturday) to take your phone calls at 1-800-980-7488.
