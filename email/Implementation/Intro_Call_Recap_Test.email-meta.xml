Thank you for taking your time today for our first call of your CRM build.  Below is a recap of the items we discussed; including information that we need from you and information we will be providing to you in further communications. Please review this list for accuracy.
Following this email, I will be sending you separate communications with instructions, documents for review and/or agreements that we will need returned as soon as possible.  We separate these into their own emails so that each can be forwarded to the person who handles that portion of the build.
