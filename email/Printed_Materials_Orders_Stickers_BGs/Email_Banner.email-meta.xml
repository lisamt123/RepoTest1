    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

As part of the package you recently purchased, we will also be working on your email banner, also known as an email header. Please see attached for some examples.

Additionally, I have a few questions that will help us in the design of your banner:

1. Which of the attached examples would you like us to use as a general layout?

If we do have the client’s logo on file:

2. Attached is the logo we have on file. Please confirm that this is the current logo that you would like to use for your email banner.

If we do not have the client’s logo on file:

2. We currently do not have your logo on file. Please provide the most current version of your logo.

3. Please verify the following information you wish to display on your email banner:

Phone Number: {!Account.Phone}


Website URL: {!Project_Piece__c.Dealer_s_Web_Address__c}


Address: {!Project_Piece__c.Project_Shipping_Address__c}


4. Is there a vehicle you would like to be featured on the banner? Please provide year, make, and model.

5. And lastly, what specific colors would you like us to use, if you have a preference? Please limit to three.

Thank you for your time!</textOnly>
