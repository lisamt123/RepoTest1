    <subject>Your VinSolutions Photo Overlay - {!Project_Piece__c.Account__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

As part of the package you recently purchased, we will also be working on your photo overlay.  Your photo overlay will appear on the primary photo of your vehicle photos in your inventory gallery (seen on third party sites and/or your website.) Please see attached for some examples.

Additionally, I have a few questions that will help us in the design of your overlay:

1. Which of the attached examples would you like us to use?

If we do have the client&apos;s logo on file:

2. Attached is the logo we have on file. Please confirm that this is the current logo that you would like to use for your photo overlay.

If we do not have the client&apos;s logo on file:

2. We currently do not have your logo on file. Please provide the most current version of your logo.

3. Please verify the following information you wish to display on your photo overlay:

Phone Number: {!Account.Phone}


Website URL: {!Project_Piece__c.Dealer_s_Web_Address__c}


Address: {!Project_Piece__c.Project_Shipping_Address__c}


4. And lastly, what specific colors would you like us to use, if you have a preference? Please limit to three.

Thank you for your time!</textOnly>
