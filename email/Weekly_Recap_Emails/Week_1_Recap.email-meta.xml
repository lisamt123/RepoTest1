Dear Dealer Team,

Today we completed the second of seven weekly phone conferences as part of our process of launching MotoSnap in your dealership.

In today’s call, we reviewed your launch setup – specifically:

Imported Data
Inventory &amp; Exports
Lead Settings
Desking
Custom Forms
User List
Manager’s Dashboard
Sales Processes
Hardware Integrations (PBX, Call Provider, Driver’s License Scanner)

As your VinPro, I am available to assist. As most of my activities are scheduled, it may be necessary to email me with your requests. Please make use of the Customer Portal to convey any technical support issues directly to our Support Department.

In our next call, scheduled for &lt;&lt;Day&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Date&gt;&gt;, at &lt;&lt;Time&gt;&gt;, we will review Manager’s Daily Duties. In addition to your Dealer Team, I encourage your sales managers to participate in next week’s call.

Please make note of any questions or issues you encounter with MotoSnap during the next week - for review during our next call.

I look forward to working with you and your Dealer Team through this transition and throughout your relationship with VinSolutions. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns you may have.

Respectfully,
