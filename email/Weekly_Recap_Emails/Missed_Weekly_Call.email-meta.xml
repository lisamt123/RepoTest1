    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Name} Team,

I’m sorry I missed you on our scheduled call today.  I do understand things come up which make keeping a schedule difficult.  However, I can’t stress the importance of our scheduled calls enough.  Your dealership spent many hours, if not days, considering the problems MotoSnap can help you solve.  Find I’m passionately committed to helping you, and your entire dealership, sell more cars using MotoSnap.

I can’t do this for you. You may have successfully completed on-site training.  You probably learned a lot.  But, there’s so much more to learn and do to improve how successful you’ll be using MotoSnap.  Our scheduled calls, for six weeks, leads you through the process of successfully integrating MotoSnap into your business model.  Those who engage in our process thrive.  Those who do not often struggle, often never realizing the full value of their investment of time and money in transitioning to VinSolutions.

Please call me to reschedule this week’s call.  Please make time and space as necessary to actively participate in developing your dealership’s use of MotoSnap.  I can’t do that for you.

I look forward to hearing from you today or tomorrow.

Respectfully,
