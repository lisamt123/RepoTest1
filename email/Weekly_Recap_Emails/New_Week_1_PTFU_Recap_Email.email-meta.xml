Dear Dealer Team,



Today we completed the second of seven weekly phone conferences as part of our process of launching MotoSnap in your dealership.



In today’s call, we reviewed your system configuration– specifically:

Imported Data
Inventory &amp; Exports
Lead Settings
Desking
Custom Forms
User List
Manager’s Dashboard
Sales Processes
Hardware Integrations (PBX, Call Provider, Driver’s License Scanner)

As your VinPro, I am available to assist with various aspects of your new VinSolutions&apos; software.  Most of the time, I have meetings scheduled throughout the day, so if you have an urgent matter, email is best method to reach me.  Please make use of the Customer Portal to quickly communicate any technical support issues directly to our Support Department.



In our next call, scheduled for &lt;&lt;Day&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Date&gt;&gt;, at &lt;&lt;Time&gt;&gt;, we will review Manager’s Daily Duties.  In addition to your Dealer Team, I encourage your sales managers to participate in next week’s call. Please make note of any questions or issues you encounter with MotoSnap over the next 6 days and we will review them during our next meeting.



I look forward to working closely with your team over the next 6 weeks, and throughout our partnership.  Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.




Regards,
