Dear Dealer Team,

Today we completed the fifth of seven weekly phone conferences as part of our process of launching MotoSnap in your dealership.

In today’s call, we reviewed your Orphan Customers, Trade-ins, Wish List and Inventory – specifically:

Orphan Customers Assignment
Reassigning Customers
Entering Trade-ins and Using the Trade Log
Building Wish List Vehicles and Using the Wish List report
Manage Inventory

As your VinPro, I am available to assist.  As most of my activities are scheduled, it may be necessary to email me with your requests.  Please make use of the Customer Portal to convey any technical support issues directly to our Support Department.

In our next call, scheduled for &lt;&lt;Day&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Date&gt;&gt;, at &lt;&lt;Time&gt;&gt;, we will review Reporting, Surveys and Sales Goals.

Please make note of any questions or issues you encounter with MotoSnap during the next week - for review during our next call.

I look forward to working with you and your Dealer Team through this transition and throughout your relationship with VinSolutions.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns you may have.

Respectfully,
