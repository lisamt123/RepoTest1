Dear Dealer Team,

Today we completed the third of seven weekly phone conferences as part of our process of launching MotoSnap in your dealership.

In today’s call, we reviewed Manager’s Daily Duties – specifically:

Ensuring salespeople are completing their tasks (not just making them disappear)
Make sure YOUR tasks are completed
Confirm appointments
Verify salespeople are completing appointments and starting Showroom Visits
Complete Showroom Visits in real-time
Update Sold Log daily
Monitor unanswered email replies
Update DMS/CRM Sales Customer Matching report

As your VinPro, I am available to assist. As most of my activities are scheduled, it may be necessary to email me with your requests. Please make use of the Customer Portal to convey any technical support issues directly to our Support Department.

In our next call, scheduled for &lt;&lt;Day&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Date&gt;&gt;, at &lt;&lt;Time&gt;&gt;, we will review Sales Processes and Templates.

Please make note of any questions or issues you encounter with MotoSnap during the next week - for review during our next call.

I look forward to working with you and your Dealer Team through this transition and throughout your relationship with VinSolutions. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns you may have.

Respectfully,
