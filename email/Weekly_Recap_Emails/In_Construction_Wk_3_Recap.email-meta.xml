Dear Dealer Team,

Today we completed the fourth of seven weekly phone conferences as part of our process of launching Motosnap in your dealership.

In today&apos;s call, we reviewed your Sales Processes and Templates - specifically:

An Overview of Sales Processes and Templates
Process Tools
Internet, Phone and Showroom Lead Follow-up
Sales Appointment Related Follow-up
Lead Status-based Follow-up (Bad, Lost,Sold,Service,End-of-Term)

As your VinPro, I am available to assist. As most of my activities are scheduled, it may be necessary to email me with your requests. Please make use of the Customer Portal to convey any technical support issues directly to our Support Department.

In our next call, scheduled for &lt;&lt;Day&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;Date&gt;&gt;,at&lt;&lt;Time&gt;&gt;, we will review Orphan Customers, Trade-ins,Wish Lists and Inventory.

Please make note of any questions or issues you encounter with Motosnap during the next week - for review during our next call.

I look forward to working with you and your Dealer Team through this transition and throughout your relationship with VinSolutions. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns you may have.

Respectfully,
