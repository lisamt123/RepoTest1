Dear Dealer Team,

Today we completed the sixth of seven weekly phone conferences as part of our process of launching MotoSnap in your dealership.

In today’s call, we reviewed Reporting, Surveys and Sales Goals – specifically:

Inventory Reports
CRM Reports
Custom Reporting and Scheduling Reports
Surveys
Sales Goals

As your VinPro, I am available to assist. As most of my activities are scheduled, it may be necessary to email me with your requests. Please make use of the Customer Portal to convey any technical support issues directly to our Support Department.

In our next call, scheduled for &lt;&lt;Day&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Date&gt;&gt;, at &lt;&lt;Time&gt;&gt;, we will review everything we’ve covered so far as well as devise/establish a plan for your future development and training.

Please make note of any questions or issues you encounter with MotoSnap during the next week - for review during our next call.

I look forward to working with you and your Dealer Team through this transition and throughout your relationship with VinSolutions.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns you may have.

Respectfully,
