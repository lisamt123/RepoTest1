Dear Dealer Team,


Today we completed the first of seven weekly phone conferences as part of our process of launching MotoSnap in your dealership. You will receive an email summarizing each weekly call shortly after each call is completed.

Today’s call introduced you, and your team, to your VinPro, {!User.Name}.  As part of this call, we discussed:

Virtual Training – Timecards
User Login History
My Role as Your VinPro
Establishing Expectations
Using the Customer Portal
Identifying Your Dealer Team
Schedule of Weekly Calls
Planned Call Topics
Your Requests &amp; Concerns
Recommended On-going Training

These calls are an integral part of your launch. We have found the success a dealership achieves using MotoSnap is directly related to utilization of the tool. The more you know, the more you and your team will be able to accomplish. It is very important you, and each member of your Dealer Team, be prepared for and participate actively in our weekly calls.

As your VinPro, I am available to assist. As most of my activities are scheduled, it may be necessary to email me with your requests. Please make use of the Customer Portal to convey any technical support issues directly to our Support Department.

In our next call, scheduled for &lt;&lt;Day&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Date&gt;&gt;, at &lt;&lt;Time&gt;&gt;, we will review how your MotoSnap is configured, based on the information provided to your Implementation Team prior to launch. This review will confirm configuration settings, data import/export, leads  routing/handling, desking settings, integrations and reporting elements necessary at this stage of your transition to MotoSnap.

Please make note of any questions or issues you encounter with MotoSnap during the next week - for review during our next call.

I look forward to working with you and your Dealer Team through this transition and throughout your relationship with VinSolutions. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns you may have.

Respectfully,
