Dear Dealer Team,

Today we completed the last of seven weekly phone conferences as part of our process of launching MotoSnap in your dealership.

In today’s call, we reviewed material presented and discussed during each of our previous weekly calls – specifically:

Our Objectives and Expectations
Launch/Implementation Review
Manager’s Daily Duties
Sales Processes and Templates
Orphan Customers, Trade-ins, Wish List and Inventory
Reporting, Surveys and Sales Goals

Although our scheduled weekly calls have been completed, I am your VinPro and available to assist. I would like to speak with you at least monthly to help you continue to develop your use of MotoSnap. Please call or email me with anything I can help you with in the interim.

It has been my pleasure to work with you and your staff through this critical transition. I look forward to your continued success with MotoSnap!

Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns you may have.

Respectfully,
