PLEASE read below and check- this is very important.&nbsp;<br><br>If you are having issues with email alerts, problems with emails going to customers that look like alerts that should have gone to the salesman and you have email masking in place you need to:&nbsp;<br><br>1) Put an exception in the forwarding rule to not forward any messages from&nbsp;<a href="http://bounces.motosnap.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); ">bounces.motosnap.com</a>, or contain Reply_To_this_Email_ in the subject line. This is to be done in your email domain where original forwarding was set up for the masking.&nbsp;<br><br>2) Or simply forwarding alerts to a non dealer domain address will avoid the issue. Sending the alerts to the users gmail, yahoo, msn account would keep the alerts from being forwarded. Just edit anywhere in Vin an alerts address is set up and take out domain email addresses and substitute with the non domain email address.&nbsp;<br><br>If your having an issue with duplicate leads hitting your system all the time.&nbsp;<br>1) Go to the settings tab then hover over the ilm/crm settings and pick lead settings (3rd one down.) Then look at the bottom of the page on the right side. Look at the lead forwarding area. Is your domain email address set up here? If so, remove it. This is only for alternate lead tools. If you have to have everything forwarded then call me and we can discuss.&nbsp;<br><br>Now to finish up please make sure that you are monitoring the items listed below.&nbsp;<br><br>1) Bad Duplicate Leads are not all BAD!! Check them daily so nothing is missed. They contain trade information, other vehicles of interest, or they may just be ready to buy today and their original active lead is days or months old. If you don't check the bad lead, you won't know and could potentially miss a sale. You may want to set up a process for "bad duplicate" leads.&nbsp;<br>2) Look at the unanswered email report daily. Remember: no email goes unanswered.&nbsp;<br>3) Make sure DMS to CRM matching is done weekly, if not daily. If not done the customers unmatched will not have sold follow up.&nbsp;<br>4) Last but not least, look at active leads with no future follow up. This report used correctly will ensure all active leads are in a process, status, and have follow up. (This is a great place to use the custom processes when finding leads not in process.)&nbsp;<br><br>If you need help with anything that I have listed above, call me!&nbsp;<br><br>Don't forget we have a new VinWorx retreat scheduled.
