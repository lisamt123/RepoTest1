    <subject>Vinsolutions - xtime Integration now live in your CRM</subject>
    <textOnly>We&apos;re excited to announce that, as a joint customer of VinSolutions and Xtime, you now have access to an Xtime Tool within your CRM that will allow you to provide a best-in-class service experience every time consumers engage
with your dealership.

This new integration enables your call centers, service advisors and even salespeople to meet any customer&apos;s service needs from any part of the dealership.

Other benefits of this integration include:

Complete Consumer Engagement: Ability to manage customer sales and service interactions all from the VinSolutions CRM tool. Any person in a dealership—from the sales person to the receptionist—can assist customers who call in, whether for a sales or service appointment, which will greatly enhance the efficiency at the dealership and the experience for the consumer.

Service Needs Transparency and Conversion: With Service Scheduling 7, the latest version of Xtime’s scheduling solution, dealers can put service packages online to provide consumers with dealer and factory recommendations, as well as the auto manufacturer’s service schedule. The Xtime Cloud solution provides dealers with consistent and accurate access to essential information, including factory menus, vehicle history, customer details and availability, enabling them to provide an exceptional experience for consumers and to maximize shop utilization.
Website Integration: More efficient and effective online service scheduling through VinSolutions and Haystak website integration.
