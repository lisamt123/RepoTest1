<br><B>Opening Keynote Address:</B>
<br>E-Commerce in Today’s Market 
<br>Our dealer clients represent a cross section of the entire dealer body, ranging from single point outlets to large metropolitan chains.  We’ve encountered a myriad of sales strategies, and practices.  Some are snake oil, while some have proven results.  I’d like to share with some successful practices that you can put to work in your dealership.
<br>Speaker: – Cody Garnett, VP of Sales, VinSolutions.
<br>________________________________________
<br><B>Foundation Module:</B>
<br>Sales and Sales Manager roles in MotoSnap.
<br>“What happens if the customer was already working with another salesperson?  What if that salesperson is no longer here?  How do I see a list of all my customers?  What am I supposed to do when I get here in the morning?  Why do I keep getting these tasks when I’ve already talked to this guy?” 
Heard these questions before?  Let us help you answer the questions that your staff has been asking you.
<br>Instructor: Jim Nelson, Product Trainer, VinSolutions.

<br>________________________________________


<br><B>Core Curriculum:</B>
<br>Administrative Responsibilities in Motosnap.
<br>In today's business environment the one constant is change and IT is feeling the pressure. Internal and external demands for greater flexibility, efficiency, and visibility have created the perfect storm for a paradigm shift in the way we build, integrate and execute new technologies both inside and outside the four walls. And for many, MotoSnap is just the latest concept in a field littered with failed initiatives and ideas. But MotoSnap is not a thing... it's a state of mind - a way of building things - a way of responding proactively to the constancy of change. And its success depends on you.
<br>Instructor: Jim Nelson, Product Trainer, VinSolutions.
<br>________________________________________
<br><B>Breakout Sessions:</B>
<br>Managing your store’s follow up processes in MotoSnap.
<br>Create a custom follow up Process:
<br>The rubber meets the road when attendees build custom follow up processes for new internet leads, unsold showroom visits, missed appointments, and sold follow up.  Work with your teammates, experiment and brainstorm in a safe virtual environment.  Your ideas can be reviewed and discussed without the peril of affecting live customers in your own system.
<br>________________________________________
<br><B>Tune up and Supercharge:</B>
<br>Delivering World Class BDC Performance.
<br>Need help capturing emails?  Are your appointments failing to show up?  How’s that closing percentage on phone traffic?  Let our VinSolutions Certified Business Development Consultants look for ways to improve your tools and ultimately, your bottom line.
<br>________________________________________
<br><B>Streamlining your operations:</B>
<br>Integrations and Maintenance.
