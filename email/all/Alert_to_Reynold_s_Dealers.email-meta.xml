    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 
In response to the need to
support multiple vehicle statuses via RCI integration, Reynolds &amp; Reynolds
is releasing  enhancements to the Reynolds Certified Interface (RCI)
Friday night.  By Saturday evening, the majority of Reynolds dealers
should have this enhancement in place.  

 

The enhancement will allow
inventory to be screened by Status group, instead of just by status.  For
example – you may choose to include in your inventory feed to VinSolutions, all
vehicles in account status 1,2 3, and 4.  Currently the only Status Code
included is 1.  After the enhancement, and with proper configuration on
behalf of the dealer, all statuses included in the status group “IN STOCK” will
be transmitted to VinSolutions.  This “IN STOCK” status group can be
controlled in the following screens:

 

New vehicle status groups are
set up in screen 4158.

Pre Owned vehicle status groups
are set up in screen 4162.



Important:  When this update is in place, Reynolds &amp; Reynolds will
only be providing VinSolutions with inventory that is included in the Status
Group “IN STOCK”.  

For assistance in validating the
inventory in your VinSolutions account or general questions regarding this
enhancement, please contact support at 913.825.6300 opt 2, or email us at support@vinsolutions.com.
