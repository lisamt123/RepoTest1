Hello everyone,

Just to make everyone aware, I have posted the Admin, Manager and salesperson manuals in the content section of sales force. If you do not see the content tab, click on the arrow at the end of your Sales Force toolbar. From there you can customize your tool bar that is labeled "customize my tabs". Follow the link and when you arrive on the next page you can add or remove the tabs on your page from the multi-pick list. 

Also the manuals are also posted in the solution base so our customer's may access them as well. Just type anything related to the manual, such as "manual" or "admin" and you will be redirected to the answer with the manual listed in an attachment. 

If anyone has any questions please let me know.
