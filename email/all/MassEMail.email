Hi,

I set all of you up with mass email folders, so you can mass email your customers whenever you choose to. The groupings are set up in relation to your assigned states. To access your lists you need to be on the Sales Force homepage. Towards the bottom of the page on the left hand side under custom links, you will see mass emails, click the link. You will be redirected to a view page with the default of all, change the default to your name and this will pull up your customer base. 

You can design your own templates by clicking the email templates link located in the custom links section on the homepage. Click new template and design your email from here. Make sure you check the box that makes the email available for use. 

If anyone needs any help with this please let me know.
