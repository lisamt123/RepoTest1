<![CDATA[Hi {!Contact.Name},<br><br>My name is Sarah McDannel. Effective immediately, I will be your new Dealer Advocate (VinPro) at VinSolutions. Chad Boyce has done an excellent job handling your account, and I assure you that I will do the same. Chad has accepted a new position in the VinSolutions Implementation Department. We are excited for Chad and this is a well-deserved move. He will take with him the experience from support and assisting all of you to our Implementation team, which can only yield great things for you and VinSolutions.<br><br>Let me start by letting you know a little bit about me. I have worked as an internet director in dealerships for over 10 years. I understand the inner workings of dealerships, and have been committed to constant success of each and every team I have been a part of. Because I have been in your shoes and been a part of a team just like yours, I know that I can work with you to ensure you have the best possible relationship with VinSolutions and hopefully you will allow me to be a valued asset to your dealership and dealership’s personnel.<br><br>I would like to coordinate your support efforts, and assume the position as your primary point of contact on behalf of VinCare. <br><br>I will continue with your account as long as you are a client. It’s my ambition to be an asset to you and your team as you make this transition, and as long as you are a client.<br><br>My daily goal is to be available to your group for special concerns or questions. As I generally conduct calls of an hour or more with dealership account Admins and Managers, I may not be as readily available as our regular VinCare team. So please assist me by directing the bulk of your staff and their concerns to our VinCare department. <br><br>VinCare offers three options for assisting your staff with issues including, but not limited to: user administration, process editing, lead settings and distributions are welcome through any of these mediums.<br><br>•E-mail<br>Email your questions and issues to VinCare.
