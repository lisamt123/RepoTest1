Training Schedule:    
Please review and verify the information on the agenda is correct and can be accommodated by all attendees.  We&apos;ve attempted to schedule attendees by role responsibility and schedule, but your involvement in this process is crucial.  Please distribute the final approved schedule to all attendees prior to training date.

Please complete this brief profile regarding the training environment.
 
FAX the approved Agenda, User List, and Facility with the signature of either the Dealer Principal or the General Manager to:  (913) 825-6396.  
 
It is important for us to account for alterations to the installation prior to our arrival.  If these forms are not received at VinSolutions by  INSERT DATE  the training dates are subject to postponement.
 
Best Practices to maximize effectiveness of Training and Installation:


Please make an effort to avoid conflicts with other initiatives.

At least one sales manager should attend every Salesperson class.

Make clear that CRM utilization is Dealer Mandated.  This kind of change doesn&apos;t happen without a clear commitment to succeed.

Make MotoSnap the means of measuring performance.

Encourage Post-Training certification through our online curriculum.
Thank you for your thorough review and timely response.  With your help, we anticipate a great launch, and look forward to assuming our role in the success of your dealership.</textOnly>
