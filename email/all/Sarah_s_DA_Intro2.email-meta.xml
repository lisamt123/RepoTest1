    <subject>Sarah McDannel, your new Dealer Advocate at VinSolutions</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Name},

My name is Sarah McDannel. Effective immediately, I will be your new Dealer Advocate (VinPro) at VinSolutions. Chad Boyce has done an excellent job handling your account, and I assure you that I will do the same. Chad has accepted a new position in the VinSolutions Implementation Department. We are excited for Chad and this is a well-deserved move. He will take with him the experience from support and assisting all of you to our Implementation team, which can only yield great things for you and VinSolutions.

Let me start by letting you know a little bit about me. I have worked as an internet director in dealerships for over 10 years. I understand the inner workings of dealerships, and have been committed to constant success of each and every team I have been a part of. Because I have been in your shoes and been a part of a team just like yours, I know that I can work with you to ensure you have the best possible relationship with VinSolutions and hopefully you will allow me to be a valued asset to your dealership and dealership’s personnel.

I would like to coordinate your support efforts, and assume the position as your primary point of contact on behalf of VinCare. 

I will continue with your account as long as you are a client. It’s my ambition to be an asset to you and your team as you make this transition, and as long as you are a client.

My daily goal is to be available to your group for special concerns or questions. As I generally conduct calls of an hour or more with dealership account Admins and Managers, I may not be as readily available as our regular VinCare team. So please assist me by directing the bulk of your staff and their concerns to our VinCare department. 

VinCare offers three options for assisting your staff with issues including, but not limited to: user administration, process editing, lead settings and distributions are welcome through any of these mediums.

•E-mail
Email your questions and issues to VinCare. Email address for support@vinsolutions.com

•Customer Portal
The Customer Portal gives users with manager and admin roles easy access to all sorts of information. You can come here to look for solutions to your questions, submit development ideas for us, keep track of your open tickets, get VinCare contact information, and much more. This is an excellent tool that we are very excited about!

•Phone
VinCare is available during the day (Monday thru Saturday) to take your phone calls at 1-800-980-7488.

My contact information is listed below. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns, and I am looking forward to working with you in the near future!
