Participation in the program allows for Kia Motors to manage and track how the OEM certified leads are being handled at your dealership.  The customizable sales and service processes provided in the VinConnect CRM and ILM products should allow for our dealership to efficiently and effectively manage all leads.
As always, your Performance Manager can help with customizing your software to help maximize your dealership’s response times and ensure leads are handled properly.
