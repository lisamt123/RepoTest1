Thank you for your time on the phone today.

As we discussed, I will continue to be your main point of contact for  as we enter the one week warranty period for your live site. During this time, I will be working closely with {!SFDC_520_Quote__c.00N70000002tn5s}. Once the warranty period is over, {!SFDC_520_Quote__c.00N70000002tn5s} will be your primary point of contact for any updates or questions you may have about your website. If there are any changes or concerns that youâ€™d like to discuss, you can reach out to me or you can email websitesupport@vinsolutions.com.
