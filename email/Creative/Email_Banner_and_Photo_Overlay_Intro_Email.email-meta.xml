    <subject>Your VinSolutions Photo Overlay and Email Banner - {!Project_Piece__c.Account__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Project_Piece__c.Contact__c},

As part of the package you recently purchased, we will also be working on your email banner and photo overlay. Please see attached for some examples.

Additionally, I have a few questions that will help us in the design of your email banner and photo overlay:

If we do have the client’s logo on file:
1. Attached is the logo we have on file. Please confirm that this is the current logo that you would like to use for your email banner.

If we do not have the client’s logo on file:
1. We currently do not have your logo on file. Please provide the most current version of your logo. A hi-res logo (300 dpi) is best.

2. The theme of your current site is [INSERT COLORS USED]. Would you like this to carry over to your email banner and photo overlay as well, for a unified feel? Or would you prefer other colors? Please limit to three.

Email Banner:
1. Which of the attached examples would you like us to use?

2. Please verify the phone number(s) you would like to provide. Please limit to three.

3. Please verify that you do or do not wish for your website URL to appear on your banner ({!Project_Piece__c.Dealer_s_Web_Address__c}).

4. Please verify the address below as the one that you would like to appear on your banner:

{!Project_Piece__c.Project_Shipping_Address__c}


Photo Overlay:
1. Which of the attached examples would you like us to use?

If the client has an overlay current on his/her site and it appears on our inventory:
Currently, you have an overlay on your images in the system. Will you be taking new pictures of your vehicles?

If not, please note that the current overlay is now attached to the photo and the new overlay will need to be designed to fit over it.

2. Please verify the phone number(s) you would like to display. Please limit to two.

3. Please verify that you do or do not wish for your website URL to appear on your overlay: {!Project_Piece__c.Dealer_s_Web_Address__c}

4. Would you like us to list your address on your overlay? If so, please verify the address below as the one that you would like to appear on your overlay:

{!Project_Piece__c.Project_Shipping_Address__c}


Thank you and have a great day!</textOnly>
