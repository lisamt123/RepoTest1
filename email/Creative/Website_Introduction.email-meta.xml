Congratulations on your new VinSolutions Best Practice Model Website! I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself as your Creative Project Manager. 
 
During this initial process, I may contact you for any information not available on your current website. At this time, we are gathering content and details to help make your website transition as smooth as possible.
 
Here is the information that we have on file for your website.
 
Domain: {!Project_Piece__c.Dealer_s_Web_Address__c}
OEM to be represented: 
Inventory Type(s): [{!Project_Piece__c.OwnerFullName}, please choose a category. For example: New and Used, Pre-Owned, Commercial, Rentals, etc.]
 
Please let me know if any of the above is incorrect.
 
Although I may not need to request any additional information for this initial step, I will reach out to you once our research is done to review your website. 
 
If you believe you have received this message in error, or if you would prefer that I communicate with someone else at your dealership, please let me know and I apologize for any inconvenience.
 
On behalf of the VinSolutions Creative Team, thank you for choosing us as your website provider!
 
Sincerely,
