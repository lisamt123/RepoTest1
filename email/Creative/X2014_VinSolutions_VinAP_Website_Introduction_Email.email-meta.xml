    <subject>Your Website for {!SFDC_520_Quote__c.Account__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!SFDC_520_Quote__c.Contact__c},

Congratulations on your new website! I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself as your Website Implementation Consultant.

I would like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss details needed to get started on your website. Please be prepared to discuss the theme, dealership information, site content and inventory pricing.

Please begin to familiarize yourself with the designs available by clicking here.  Our goal is to have the homepage design selected by the end of our first call.

Before we get together, please copy and paste the URLs below into your browser to complete some basic information about your dealership and website:

New Website Packet: http://form.jotform.us/form/51304003830135

SEO Packet: http://form.jotform.us/form/51303664275150

If you believe you have received this message in error, or if you would prefer that I communicate with someone else at your dealership, please let me know and I apologize for any inconvenience.

**Please note- it is imperative that all stakeholders or those who must give final approval before the sites launch be involved.  Doing so will help prevent the goal launch date from being impacted.

On behalf of the VinSolutions Website Team, thank you for choosing us as your website provider!

Sincerely,
{!SFDC_520_Quote__c.Project_Owner_Name__c}
