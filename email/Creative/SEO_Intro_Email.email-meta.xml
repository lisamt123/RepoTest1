Congratulations on your new VinSolutions website!  All VinSolutions websites include our Advanced Search Engine Optimization (SEO). I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself as your SEO Manager and let you know what you can expect regarding SEO on your new website.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;



Your VinSolutions website will automatically include the following:



· Custom optimization for your target audience based on 3 SEO cities chosen by you


· Dynamically created optimized content to continually get your website pages indexed by search engines


· Customized page titles, keywords, and descriptions specific to your dealership, location, inventory, &amp; industry relevant keywords


· Customized homepage SEO scroller (not available on portals or splash pages) with keywords and links to inventory


· Dynamically created Recent Customers pages (new car sold data only with VinSolutions CRM) to automatically get you ranked for makes, models and locations


· Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools monitoring


· Site submission to Google, Bing &amp; Baidu


· VinSolutions step-by-step guides to creating Google, Bing, &amp; Yelp Local Places

No action is required from you at this time for the above to occur. The SEO department will work closely with your Creative Project Manager to ensure your site is optimized both before and after your site is launched. Once your site is live, the SEO department will reach out to you again.



Until then, thank you for choosing us as your website provider!




Sincerely,
