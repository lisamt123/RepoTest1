Thank you for your time on the phone today.

As  we discussed, I will continue to be your main point of contact as we enter the one week warranty period for your live site. During this time, I will be working closely with our Lexus support team. Once the warranty period is over, I will introduce you to a primary Lexus support team member that will be assisting you with any updates or questions you may have about your website. If there are any changes or concerns that youâ€™d like to discuss, you can reach out to me or you can email lexussupport@haystak.com.

Congratulations on your new website and thank you for choosing VinSolutions!


Sincerely,
