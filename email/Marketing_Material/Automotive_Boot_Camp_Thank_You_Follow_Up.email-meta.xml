    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName}, 
 
We hope you enjoyed your stay in Las Vegas for the 3rd Annual Automotive Boot Camp. Thank you for visiting the VinSolutions booth!  

It would be great to stay in touch with you and answer any questions you may have had during the event. We can also arrange a follow up with one of our team members to discuss our suite of products in more detail, and send information directly to your dealership.  VinLens360 Full Life Cycle Tracker, Push Advanced Coupons, DIY Campaigns and our Customer Service Portal are just a few new developments highlighted that sets VIN apart from any other. 
 
We also encourage you to stay in touch with us and our announcements via Facebook (www.facebook.com/VinSolutions) and Twitter (www.twitter.com/VinSolutions) with exclusive insights, notices and product news. 

We look forward to connecting with you soon, and seeing you at future shows!
