RE: VinSolutions&apos; {!Opportunity.00N70000002MRji} Proposal

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We’re pleased to present this proposal for a VinSolutions
products package tailored to fit your specific dealership’s needs. When you
select VinSolu­tions, you are teaming up with outstanding software developers,
knowl­edgeable sales people, thorough trainers, and dedicated customer service
consultants. Our goal is to partner with you for the life of your business. We
understand that long-lasting relationships based on trust are valuable, and to
show our good faith we won’t ask you to sign a long-term contract. We’ll earn
your trust and your business every day by providing you with the best products
and services in the industry. 



When we receive the following information, we’ll initiate the
solutions se­quence that will help you drive your dealership’s success: 

Go to http://www.vinsolutions.com and click the “create account”
tab at the top right hand corner. 



Read and click the “I read and understood” icon just above the
continue button, then click the continue button. 



Fill out the required fields and click on the “sign-up!” tab. An
e-mail will be sent to your Regional Manager and they will contact you shortly.


Please note any alterations to this proposed solutions package
will necessi­tate a new quoted price reflecting the desired changes. We look
forward to working with you, and appreciate the opportunity you’ve given us to
earn your business. 

Best Regards,
