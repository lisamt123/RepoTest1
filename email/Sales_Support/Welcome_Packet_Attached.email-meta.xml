    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

  
Your set â€“up packet is attached. 
Please include the dealer name on each form it is not already on. It is very important we receive this paperwork back within the next few days. 
The forms should be faxed to (913) 273-1924 when completed. If you have any questions regarding this paperwork please contact your implementation manager, Matt Bench at (800) 980-7488 ext. 169 or myself.
 
Also,  If you sign up for paperless billing through ACH you will receive a 5% discount on each monthly bill.  I strongly recommend this payment method considering we pass our saving on to you. If this is something you may be interested in, fill out the attached ACH form and send it back. For further information please contact me. 
 
Thank you and have a wonderful week,
