On September 1st, 2009 GM had VinSolutions change the process to sending dispositions in near real time. As part of that switch there was a technical issue with how the data was being sent. Response times for basically all of September are about 5 hours off. When GM issues reports at the end of the month all the reports will say something like "Data not available" because of the issue. GM is aware of the issue and won't be penalizing any dealers over the issue. The issue has since been resolved and will be fine going forward.

If you are still concerned, you can contact the Customer Care Specialists (CCS) at the OneSource Helpdesk at 1-877-999-9179 prompt #2.
