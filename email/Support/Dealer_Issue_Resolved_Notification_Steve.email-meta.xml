The issue reported below has been resolved by our developers and tested by VinSolutions Support to be working. Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience your dealership experienced while we worked to understand, diagnose and fix the problem.

Case Subject: 
The ability to capitalize upfront taxes in a lease deal in Desking 3.0 is no longer functioning.

Case Description: 
When creating a lease deal in Desking the option to capitalize Upfront Taxes is not available from the &quot;Total Due at Signing&quot; screen if the user has recently deleted the browser history. We also found that in the Total Taxes window, there is now a button labeled &quot;Capped&quot; next to the Upfront Taxes which does not appear to function.  



Sincerely,
