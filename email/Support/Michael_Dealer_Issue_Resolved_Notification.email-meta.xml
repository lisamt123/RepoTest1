    <textOnly>Good evening {!Contact.FirstName},



On the morning of 1/20/16 we started to have failures in receiving OEM direct post leads via our API.



The root cause for this issue was identified and resolved at 3pm central time.  Leads were received and parsed into the CRM as expected..



If you have any related concerns or questions regarding your case, please contact the support team at 800.980.7488 and reference your case number.
