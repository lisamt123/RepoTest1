    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



As of May 19th, 2016, we will be deactivating the birthday process for ILM only accounts. This process was intended for full CRM accounts that handle their customer relationship &amp; follow-up within the CRM. Please note that all other processes and their activities will function as expected for ILM only accounts.

If you have any questions or concerns about this change please reach our Technical Support (800.980.7488) for assistance.


Sincerely,

VinSolutions Technical Support
