    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName} ,

I wanted to get in touch with you regarding your PBX Phone System Integration. It appears that the data has not been pulled since [Last Import Date] and I wanted to check with you to see if we can help to get this updating again. I am including some troubleshooting steps that should help get this Integration updating again.

STEP 1:

Please, check on your application status and verify that phone data is coming through by going to, (For Serial cable connection) START --&gt; All Programs --&gt; TAPIT --&gt; SMDR (TAPIT) Monitor (For IP Connection) START --&gt; All Programs --&gt; Trisys IP Collector Once the applications are up and running on your screen, you should see your call logs coming in through this application window

STEP 2:

Then browse on the computer&apos;s hard drive to, c:\tapitw32\telmsg.dat -or possibly- c:\tapit32\data\main\telmsg.dat And, make sure you have telmsg.dat in this folder.
If you do have a data file with recent date/time stamp, it means that your application is running properly.

STEP 3:

Finally, go to,
Start --&gt; All Programs --&gt; Accessories --&gt; System Tools --&gt; Scheduled Task and, force a RUN on your task named FTP_TEST or FTP_SCRIPT

This should initiate a file drop and we should be able to confirm a successful transfer.

At this point you may reply to this email to ask if it is now working again or wait to see if you are sent another one of these emails the next day.

If you are no longer using this product, please be sure to let me know and I will update our records and remove you from the PBX list.

I look forward to assisting in getting this updated. Thanks

Thanks.
