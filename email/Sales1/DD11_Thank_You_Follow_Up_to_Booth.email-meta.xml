    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName}, 
 
I hope that you enjoyed your stay in Las Vegas at the 11th Annual Digital Dealer Convention.  Thank you for visiting VinSolutions!  I want to make sure the time you invested in our booth has paid off by answering any questions you may still have about our Complete Dealer Marketing Solution and the competitive advantage it delivers. 
 
In the event you did not get a personal demonstration while at the show, we can arrange one from the privacy and quiet of your own office.  Please give me a call or email to arrange a Webinar or personal in-store meeting.  My information is below.
 
You may have picked up some information sheets on our products while at the show and/or via this email.  I would be happy to send more to share with your dealership.  VinLens360 Full Life Cycle Tracker, Push Advanced Coupons, DIY Campaigns and our Customer Service Portal are just a few new developments highlighted that sets VIN apart from any other. 
 
Finally, the Be One with VIN Give Away is still in full swing with more prizes up for grabs!  We have over 20,000 entries so far, including you.  Find out who has already won; 55&quot; flatscreen TVs, iPads, iPhones, iPods, iTunes Giftcards and more, and follow us for future announcements on Facebook (www.facebook.com/VinSolutions) and Twitter (www.twitter.com/VinSolutions) with exclusive insights, notices and prizes for our dealer customers at the VinCommunity (www.VinCommunity.com ).  Find out more at www.BeOneWithVIN.com. 
 
I look forward to speaking with you soon.
 
Sincerely,
