I wanted to use this opportunity to introduce myself. I have recently taken over for Cliff Jackson as your Regional Sales Manager. I was previously the Regional Sales Manager for our West Coast operations and held that position for 2 years. This being said, I am well equipped to answer any questions or concerns you may have moving forward. I am also able to answer any sales related questions. Please feel free to contact me directly for any additional assistance you may need. I truly value your business and look forward to a long and prosperous relationship. Thank you for your time in this matter and have a great day. 

Best Regards,
