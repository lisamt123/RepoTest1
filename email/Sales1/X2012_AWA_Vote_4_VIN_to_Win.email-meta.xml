Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

VinSolutions has AGAIN been nominated to be recognized with an AWA! In order to add even MORE value to the results, PCG Digital Marketing, the automotive consulting firm behind the peer-reviewed awards, has asked that our valued dealers provide some feedback: http://bit.ly/Vin4AWA

The 2012 awards program has been expanded to include more product and platform categories, more comprehensive scoring metrics, and greater distribution of results by offering the final review guide book as a free digital download on iTunes, Google Play, and Amazon. Be sure to sign-up for yours while you provide insight into the VIN products that help give your dealership the competitive advantage: http://bit.ly/Vin4AWA
