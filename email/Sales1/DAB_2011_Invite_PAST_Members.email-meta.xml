    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I would like to personally invite you, as a distinguished part of the 2010 VinSolutions Dealer Advisory Board, to again join us in 2011.  Your professional contributions have directly impacted Vin’s tremendous growth and success - we thank you for taking on this responsibility in the past, and for your consideration towards the future. 

VinSolutions is a company built by auto dealers for auto dealers.  Your continued support and feedback is invaluable as we continue to lead the auto industry in cutting-edge technology and fully-integrated solutions.  As a Board Member, your voice is heard first and your ideas are taken under advisement for development as our foremost priority; providing to you a unique opportunity to not only help shape the direction of Vin, but the entire industry.

SAVE THE DATE:  The DAB will meet at least once this year, starting with the first April 16th-18th prior to Digital Dealer 10 in Orlando at the Rosen Shingle Creek Hotel.  You may also be invited to opportunities throughout the year to promote your dealership through printed and digital publication, advertisements, speaking events and other VinSolutions’ sponsorships.  BE ONE WITH VIN in 2011!

DAB Vegas was a huge success (thank you!).  We listened to your suggestions and have modified the DAB Orlando agenda to make it even better.  Later meeting times, shorter days and breakout sessions specific to Internet and other management duties are just a few of those changes.  Vin will pay for one hotel room during your attendance to the upcoming and all future DAB meetings for you only, as a member.  We encourage you to invite your Sales, Internet or other manager for more in depth and individual training sessions while we cover broader view demonstrations and discuss higher level goals and initiatives. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.  TO RSVP: Please call or email your Regional Manager, Marketing Manager, Gina Reuscher (gina.reuscher@vinsolutions.com), or me directly.  I look forward to your answer by the end of next week, March 11th so that we can reserve your spot for 2011!

GodSpeed!
