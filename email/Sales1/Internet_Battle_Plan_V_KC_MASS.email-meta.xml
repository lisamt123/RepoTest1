Vin&apos;s very own Sean Stapleton, Chief Sales Officer, will join Ralph Paglia, Larry Bruce, Jim Ziegler and Special Guest Speakers to demonstrate numerous techniques, word tracts, strategies and real-life examples of dealerships that are dominating their competitors with technology-enabled marketing and Internet programs. This is hands-on &apos;real-world&apos; stuff, not theory.
