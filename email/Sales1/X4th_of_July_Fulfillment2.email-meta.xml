    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
The 4th of July is right around the corner and if you
haven’t already planned on marketing this event, VinSolutions can help.

The deadline to get this out in time for the big selling
weekend is fast approaching.

 

Please give me a call today at 800-980-7488 ext. 212 or send
me an email at carrie.bermel@vinsolutions.com.

 

Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you soon!
