Now the question is... do your customers know that?<br>
  <br>
          The new 2012 Civics are about to arrive, and they are sure to turn heads, so now is the time to get your customers excited about the car that fits nearly every kind of driver. In just a few weeks, VinSolutions will be rolling out our 2012 Civic promotional package, to help you build that excitement, but before you start selling 2012 models, you need to start clearing the 2011s off the lot. VinSolutions already has you covered with our 2011 Honda Civic promotional package.<br>
          <br>
          This package helps bring customers to your dealership to see how a single car can serve the driving needs of cost conscious individuals, small families, sports car enthusiasts, and even the environmentally concious.  </p>
