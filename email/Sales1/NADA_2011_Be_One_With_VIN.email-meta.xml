    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Will you be in San Fran for NADA 2011?  VinSolutions wants to see you there!  Please call or email me so we can set up a meeting..or stop by the VIN Booth #4574N.  

We are excited to be holding a press conference on Saturday, February 5th from 11am-11:45am at the Moscone Center Room #228.  We will have some announcements that I know you will want to hear.

Nebraska Football Legend, Johnny Rodgers, will be joining us at the booth again this year.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to have your photo taken with &quot;The Jet&quot; alongside his 1972 Heisman Trophy.  We will also be giving away a football signed by more than 30 Heisman winners, including new inductee, Cam Newton of Auburn University.  What a perfect way to celebrate Super Bowl weekend with VIN!

Whether or not you will be attending NADA, be sure to register today at www.VinToWin.com to receive your Be One With Vin wristband and your chance to win up to $150K in prizes; 55&quot; Flat Screen TVs, iPads, MacBooks, giftcards and more.  One dealer (maybe you!) may win a VinPackage that includes a suite of FREE Vin products and services for an entire year!  
 
You do not have to attend NADA to win!  But once you are there, you DO have to be wearing a Be One with Vin wristband to win even MORE.  Announcements will be made through Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/VinSolutions), Twitter (http://twitter.com/vinsolutions), and the VinCommunity (http://community.vinsolutions.com/), so make sure you are signed up EVERYWHERE.

And finally, before things get crazy before NADA - give me a call me today and we can chat from the comfort of our own offices.  I would love to go over some new products with you, or schedule a demo.

I look forward to it!
