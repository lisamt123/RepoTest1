Subject: Time to Rate Your Vendors

Hey there,
We&apos;re coming to the end of another great year full of new knowledge, new experiences and a multitude of new vendors and dealership service innovations. As the world’s largest social network and community for car dealer best practices, we are committed to providing a venue where dealers can share their views and opinions about the products and vendors they use.
 
As part of this commitment, DrivingSales publishes quarterly ratings and reviews of products as rated exclusively by YOU, the dealers who use them. In addition, at the conclusion of each year, we compile the results from the entire year and announce the top annual Vendor Ratings. We do all of this so that dealerships have easy access to valid vendor ratings (good and bad – from peers who use them) before signing on with a new service provider or purchasing a new product that claims to be ‘the next big thing!’
 
This is how it works:
 
1. Dealership employees rate their vendors at http://drivingsales.com/ratings
2. DrivingSales verifies that each reviewer is a dealership employee
3. Verified ratings and reviews are published at DrivingSales.com
 
We ask that you rate and review your vendors once a quarter to keep the rankings current. Other dealers depend on the vendor accountability this encourages.  Please take a few minutes to fill out our vendor rating survey and help raise the bar in our industry. http://www.drivingsales.com/surveys/vr/customer-management
 
Finally, there is CSI for dealership vendors! How do your vendors rate?
