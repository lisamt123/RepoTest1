    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},
 
Will you be in Las Vegas for the 11th Digital Dealer?  VinSolutions wants to see you there at Booth #709!  
 
You&apos;ll want to stop by for a chance to draw a $1,000 Mirage gaming chip from our no obligation instant-win bowl.  Space is always limited for personal attention and we want to reserve time with YOU, so please call or email to set up a meeting customized to your specific ILM, CRM, Inventory, Market Pricing, Desking, Website, Marketing, Advertising and other needs.  We are confident that www.vinsolutions.com has the tools to help you become more profitable for less.
 
Nebraska Football Legend, Johnny Rodgers, will also be joining us at the booth again this year.  Be sure to have your photo taken with &quot;The Jet&quot; alongside his 1972 Heisman Trophy to be a part of history greatness.
 
Whether or not you will be attending DD11, be sure to register today at www.BeOneWithVin.com for your chance to win up to $150,000 in prizes; 55&quot; Flat Screen TVs, iPads, MacBooks, giftcards and more.  We still have 1 VinPackage to award in 2011 for one dealer (maybe you!) that includes a suite of FREE Vin products and services for an entire year!  
 
You do not have to attend to win!  But once you are there, you DO have to be wearing a Be One with Vin wristband (available at Booth #709) to win even MORE.  Announcements will be made through Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/VinSolutions), Twitter (http://twitter.com/vinsolutions), and the VinCommunity (http://www.VinCommunity.com), so make sure you are signed up EVERYWHERE.
 
And finally, before things do get crazy before DD11 - give us a call today and we can chat from the comfort of our own offices.  We would love to go over some new products with you, or schedule a demo.
 
Sincerely,
The VinSolutions Team
