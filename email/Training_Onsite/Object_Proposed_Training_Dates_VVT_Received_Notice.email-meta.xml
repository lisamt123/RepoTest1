    <textOnly>Dear {!Training__c.Training_Contact__c},

I am contacting you because the Training Department has been notified that your Performance Manager has requested training for your dealership. Before we can begin scheduling please provide the below information so we can offer the best dates for your rooftop.

Are there any date conflicts we need to be aware of, ie: Vacations, dealership events, ect.?
Would you be open to a date offer at the last minute?


Although our calendar is full at the moment, there is often movement. We appreciate your patience as we adjust our calendar for your dealership to work with one of our trainers. The wait time can be 3 - 5 weeks before dates are proposed for your review.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be happy to provide you assistance.

Thank You,
