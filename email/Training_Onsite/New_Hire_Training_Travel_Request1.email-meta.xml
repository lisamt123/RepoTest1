    <textOnly>Dear ,

Each of you will be coming to Kansas City for New Hire Training Wk #. A conference room has been reserved for you by Greg and he will direct you to the correct one.

Dates:

The days will be from 9:00a â€“ 6:00p with business casual. You should arrive Sunday evening and your Friday flights may depart no earlier than 6:00p. Since only # will be traveling, # vehicles reserved. Please discuss amongst yourselves who will be the drivers and let me know. Please make your hotel reservation at the Drury Inn Shawnee Mission Parkway via Cox Travel when you book your flight. The Drury is set up for a direct bill so you will not pay for your stay. Please be sure to grab a receipt from the Drury upon checkout to send to Team Travel.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
