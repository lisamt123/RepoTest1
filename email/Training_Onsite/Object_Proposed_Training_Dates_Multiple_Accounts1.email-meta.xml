Since you have multiple locations training at the same time, do you want us to assign a lead trainer for your group? A Lead Trainer will provide:

Coordinate all agendas.
Facilitate all communication between the training team and the dealership group.
Assists in managing the option for combined training classes.


If your team does not need a lead trainer, which of your rooftops acts as the &quot;main&quot; or the &quot;corporate&quot; location?



We need the following items from you to move forward.

Reply to this email to confirm your training dates and travel costs.
Do you want a lead trainer?
Which location is your &quot;main&quot; or &quot;corporate&quot; location?


By replying to this email, I acknowledge receipt and understanding of travel and expenses for each of our locations training. Travel and expenses will be billed at a rate of {!Training__c.Total_Travel_Cost__c} for each rooftop. This includes airfare, hotel, ground transportation, incidentals, and per diem.

Thank You,
