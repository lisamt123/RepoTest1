1. Take a left out of the circle parking lot at the front and turn right onto 47th Street out front

2. Turn left on Belleview Ave…I think this is the 2nd light. The first light is a one way street. You’ll go up a hill then turn.

3. Go through another light then turn Right on Ward Parkway/56

4. This street has some twists and turns. You’ll come to a sharp curve with the option to go right or left. Follow 56 to the right. This will go past a school and cross State Line Rd. (Ward Parkway will continue to the left.)

5. Continue on 56. This is also called Johnson Drive and Shawnee Mission Parkway and 169. You’ll follow this for about 5 miles.

6. Take the exit for North 69th/Metcalf Ave on the right.

7. You’ll go through a light with Target on the right. Continue past Panara Bread. Take the next right turn (no light and little indication of the turn). This is W 58th St.

8.  At the stop sign, turn right on Broadmoor St.

9.  VinSolutions is in the tall tan building with the white top. Park above the parking garage. You’ll go to the 9th floor.
