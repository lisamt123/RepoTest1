Google Map

Exit the airport on Cookingham Drive and get on highway I-29/US-71 South

Follow I-29/US-71 South to US-169 South

Continue South over the Missouri River. You will pass the KC Downtown Airport.

Turn Left onto W 6th St. Stay to the left and get on I-35 N / I-70 E / US-24 E

Stay to the right on the highway and take the exit for US-71 S.

Follow US-71 South (approx 3 ½ miles) to the exit for Euclid Ave / Emanuel Cleaver II Blvd / Swope Pkwy. It’s right after the exit for 39th St. Take a right at the first light, Emanuel Cleaver II Blvd.

Follow Emanuel Cleaver II Blvd for approx 1 ½ mile. The street will be called W 47th St once you cross Brookside Blvd.

This is a set of lights right before you enter the Plaza. There will be a fountain on the right and tennis courts on the left. Once you enter the Plaza, PF Chang’s is on the right hand corner. Another noteworthy feature to be sure you’re in the correct area is a white statue of a man in front of PF Chang’s.

Continue through the Plaza approx ½ a mile. It will seem like a long drive since it’s usually packed. The Sheraton is on the right after Jefferson St.

Turn right onto Summit street, goes uphill. There will be a parking garage here. You can park in the front circle and unload first if you’d like. Both on the right.
