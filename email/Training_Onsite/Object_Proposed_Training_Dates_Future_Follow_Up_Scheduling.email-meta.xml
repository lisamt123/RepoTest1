    <textOnly>Dear {!Training__c.Training_Contact__c},

I will be your contact in arranging training dates and travel for your VinSolutions products.

Follow-up training for your dealership is tentatively scheduled as follows:

{!Training__c.Account__c} {!Training__c.Account_Number__c} {!Training__c.Training_Start_Formula__c} - {!Training__c.Training_End_formula__c}
{!Training__c.Account_Location__c}

Approximately 4 weeks prior to each of the above dates, I will reach out to you to confirm the dates.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.


Thank you,
