    <textOnly>URGENT RESPONSE NEEDED
VinSolutions Training Department

Good Day,

We have been unable to speak with you regarding your scheduled onsite VinSolutions training for {!SFDC_520_Quote__c.Account__c} {!SFDC_520_Quote__c.VS_Dealer_ID__c} scheduled {!SFDC_520_Quote__c.Proposed_Training_Start__c} - {!SFDC_520_Quote__c.Proposed_Training_End__c} with travel at a rate of {!SFDC_520_Quote__c.Total_Travel_Cost__c} for the week.

In an effort to communicate with potential decision makers, we have sent this email to additional users within your account.

On-going training is a critical part of your usage and continued success. VinSolutions is a dynamic system and changes happen often. Our most successful dealers take advantage of re-occurring training. The value of having a Training Professional onsite to work with their teams and keep them up to date with the latest releases as well as refresher classes for those seasoned sales staff.

Without a confirmation from you, I am not able to hold your scheduled spot to have a trainer onsite.

If you have meant to confirm but just missed our emails, please respond within 24 hours and lock up your time now. Our onsite trainings fill up very fast and have a waiting list of dealers looking to take advantage of this informative and productive time. Without a confirmation from you, your spot will be released to another dealer.

Our travel coordinators are here Monday â€“ Friday from 8AM until 5PM CST and we need to hear from you.
