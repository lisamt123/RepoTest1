Google Map

1. Exit the airport on Cookingham Drive and get on highway I-29/US-71 South

2. Follow I-29/US-71 South to I-635

a. Stay to the right once you pass exit 5 on 71. You’ll be able to merge onto I-635.

3. Continue on I-635 over the river and past I-70 (you’ll go under at least 1 bridge) then past a railroad service area

4. Stay on I-635. This will turn into US-69/Metcalf Ave. If you stay to the left on the highway, you’ll pass the congestion for the I-35 exit and be in the correct lane for later.

5. Once I-635 turns into US-69/Metcalf Ave, stay to the left. Turn left on W 56th St. This comes up quickly (no light and little indication of the turn).

6. W 56th St takes a right turn and becomes Broadmoor St.

7. VinSolutions is in the tall tan building with the white top. There is parking on either side of the building. If you park on the side with the garage, park above the parking garage. You’ll go to the 9th floor.
