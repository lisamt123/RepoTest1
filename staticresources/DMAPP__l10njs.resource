Their focus will be on ensuring the success of the project.

Ask your Internal Champion about other projects that this buyer has been involved in. How did he act then? Wqere the projects ultimately successful? How is he viewed within the organization? As you have the names of the buyers, Google them and see if you can determine anything further about them through the references found. All of this may help you get some understanding of their ambitions and you can start to make educated assumptions about their motivations for this project.',

You can show value through descriptions of these successful customers and through your understanding of the application of our offering to their business, contextualized for their company.<BR>Present a pertinent case study to the buying influencers. Do not just send it to them, talk it through, encouraging questions and pointing out the benefits enjoyed by the customer in the case. Before presenting, work through the case with your Internal Champion. Encourage him to point out both the similarities and the differences between his organization and the case study company. Use this information to help you when presenting the case, proactively focusing on the similarities and pointing out what the case study company didn\'t try to do, that the current company is going to be able to use for extra advantage.<BR>If possible, arrange a meeting between the LOB Manager and an existing customer.

If this is the first such application of our solution, and we know that there further opportunities in this market, then we should persist with the sale, looking to give other reassurances to the buyer that will encourage them to believe that we can meet their needs. If we don\'t believe that there are other opportunities in this market, you need to ask yourself if the effort will ultimately be worth it for a one-off sale.',

You should also be sure that you understand the company and know what\'s been happening with the organization recently (get this information from their website, brochures, recent press releases, testimonials, Analysts reports, the company\'s SEC Filings, direct conversations with their Competitors, etc.), know where the LOB Manager fits in the hierarchy, if possible, ask the Internal Champion about him in advance. She\/He needs to feel that he is getting value from us. It is important to be able to talk his language.<BR><BR><B>Continue to Pursue?:<\/B> The deal will not progress in your control until you have access to the LOB Manager and have started to build up a relationship with him. You need to ensure that your Internal Champion also has a good relationship with the LOB Manager. if not, then you may need to look for someone else to help you out within the account.',

It\'s likely that companies with new technologies will ensure that they can press release any recent sales.<BR>- Look on www.hoovers.com and www.fortune.com to find out what position the organization is in. Are they leaders in their industry? If they are it may be an indication that they stay that way by investing in new technologies that will keep them ahead of their competition.<BR>- Keep an eye on what the business analysts are saying about the organization. Forresters, Aberdeen Group and Gartner, amongst others, can be a useful resource when reviewing who\'s buying what technologies.<BR>- Finally, talk to people within the organization and get a feel for their TALC profile directly.<BR><BR><B>Continue to Pursue?:<\/B>Leading edge technologies require leading edge buyers. Early adopters of new technology offerings typically will be found in the technology or telecommunications sectors. Utilities companies, and governmental entities, are usually quite risk-averse.

CEO\/CFO - effective sales, and accurate forecasts. Sales Exec - increased revenue and easier process.<br><br>\n\n\nPersonal buying reasons are different from corporate buying decisions. Personal reasons have to do with emotion, while corporate reasons are generally based on value. If the buyer personally dislikes interacting with the individual representing the vendor, he will very rarely buy from that vendor. Buyers want to be helped, and want to develop a trusted relationship with the vendor who can help them. They value demonstrated honesty, integrity and competence. In order to determine and impact the personal motivation for each buyer, you need to build a relationship with each of them. At the very least, you need your Internal Champion to have a strong relationship with each buyer and share their motivations with you.<BR><BR>Typically, personal motivations are driven from the buyer\'s need to be respected within his organization. He wants to \"hitch his wagon\" to a successful project. In most cases, the project driver (typically the LOB Manager) wants to be seen as an instrument of change in his company. He will choose to sign with the vendor who can help him design the right solution for his company, and then help him deliver it. For this, the buyer will receive credit for identifying a good partner to work with, as well as being lauded for a successful implementation. All buyers will have something riding on this project, be it recognition at the right level within the organization, something to add to their resume, or even a promotion. Their focus will be on ensuring the success of the project. You need to have an overview of their career path to date, their ambitions for the future, how they feel about the organization their working in, and how they get on with their peers and their managers. All of these will feed into their personal motivation.<BR><BR>Once you have uncovered the personal motivation, you need to work with each buyer to develop the solution that resolves their major problems.<BR><BR><B>Continue to Pursue?:<\/B> If you are unable to get the right level of interaction to get answers to this question for all the buyers, then the project is at risk. If you don\'t know what their motivations are, then you can\'t help prove to them that you will help them achieve their goals. Use your Internal Champion to try and get answers. Ask your Internal Champion about other projects that this buyer has been involved in. How did he act then? Wqere the projects ultimately successful? How is he viewed within the organization? As you have the names of the buyers, Google them and see if you can determine anything further about them through the references found. All of this may help you get some understanding of their ambitions and you can start to make educated assumptions about their motivations for this project.',

Personal reasons have to do with emotion, while corporate reasons are generally based on value. If the buyer personally dislikes interacting with the individual representing the vendor, he will very rarely buy from that vendor. Buyers want to be helped, and want to develop a trusted relationship with the vendor who can help them. They value demonstrated honesty, integrity and competence. In order to determine and impact the personal motivation for each buyer, you need to build a relationship with each of them. At the very least, you need your Internal Champion to have a strong relationship with each buyer and share their motivations with you.<BR><BR>Typically, personal motivations are driven from the buyer\'s need to be respected within his organization. He wants to \"hitch his wagon\" to a successful project. In most cases, the project driver (typically the LOB Manager) wants to be seen as an instrument of change in his company. He will choose to sign with the vendor who can help him design the right solution for his company, and then help him deliver it. For this, the buyer will receive credit for identifying a good partner to work with, as well as being lauded for a successful implementation. All buyers will have something riding on this project, be it recognition at the right level within the organization, something to add to their resume, or even a promotion. Their focus will be on ensuring the success of the project. You need to have an overview of their career path to date, their ambitions for the future, how they feel about the organization their working in, and how they get on with their peers and their managers. All of these will feed into their personal motivation.<BR><BR>Once you have uncovered the personal motivation, you need to work with each buyer to develop the solution that resolves their major problems.<BR><BR><B>Continue to Pursue?:<\/B> If you are unable to get the right level of interaction to get answers to this question for all the buyers, then the project is at risk.

Ask your Internal Champion about other projects that this buyer has been involved in. How did he act then? Wqere the projects ultimately successful? How is he viewed within the organization? As you have the names of the buyers, Google them and see if you can determine anything further about them through the references found.

We have also already proven the value of our solution in specific industries, so selling into further organizations in these same industries will be easier than trying to launch ourselves in a brand new industry\/market.<BR><BR>If the prospect is not in our target industry \"sweet spot\", are we sure that we can overcome issues related to our lack of industry knowledge and to competitors with niche products specific to the prospect\'s industry? Is this new industry one that we specifically want to enter? If not, is it worth the effort for just one sale? Will the extra effort required result in us losing the chance to go after other opportunities in our industry \"sweet spot\"?<BR><BR>If you are looking at a prospect who does not fit in our target segment, you must consider all 3 of the factors that we used when determining our target industries. If we don\'t score positively on all 3 counts, then you should strongly consider not pursuing this opportunity.',

He wants to \"hitch his wagon\" to a successful project. In most cases, the project driver (typically the LOB Manager) wants to be seen as an instrument of change in his company. He will choose to sign with the vendor who can help him design the right solution for his company, and then help him deliver it. For this, the buyer will receive credit for identifying a good partner to work with, as well as being lauded for a successful implementation. All buyers will have something riding on this project, be it recognition at the right level within the organization, something to add to their resume, or even a promotion. Their focus will be on ensuring the success of the project. You need to have an overview of their career path to date, their ambitions for the future, how they feel about the organization their working in, and how they get on with their peers and their managers.

Maybe regulatory compliance deadlines loom. It could be that the current method of dealing with the issue results in an unprofitable production line or higher cost of sales than is accepted in the industry. There could be a new competitor who has entered the market, requiring a response from your buyer. Perhaps the buying cycle is driven by a financial budget or accounting period and if the budget isn\'t spent this year, they won\'t get it for next year. If there is an incumbent supplier, or a product or process that is being replaced, you need to understand, for example, when the maintenance period for that product runs out. The buyer will probably want to have their replacement in place by then.<BR><BR><B>Continue to Pursue?:<\/B> Until some level of urgency is injected into the buying process, there is serious risk with the project. If there is no momentum behind it, the chances are that the buyer will do nothing. You need to work hard with the buyer to remind him why he is working on this project and put some momentum back into the process.',

Uncovering the factors that drive the compelling event is essential.

Maybe regulatory compliance deadlines loom. It could be that the current method of dealing with the issue results in an unprofitable production line or higher cost of sales than is accepted in the industry. There could be a new competitor who has entered the market, requiring a response from your buyer. Perhaps the buying cycle is driven by a financial budget or accounting period and if the budget isn\'t spent this year, they won\'t get it for next year. If there is an incumbent supplier, or a product or process that is being replaced, you need to understand, for example, when the maintenance period for that product runs out. The buyer will probably want to have their replacement in place by then.<BR><BR><B>Continue to Pursue?:<\/B> Until some level of urgency is injected into the buying process, there is serious risk with the project. If there is no momentum behind it, the chances are that the buyer will do nothing. You need to work hard with the buyer to remind him why he is working on this project and put some momentum back into the process.',

CEO\/CFO - effective sales, and accurate forecasts. Sales Exec - increased revenue and easier process.<br><br>\n\n\nPersonal buying reasons are different from corporate buying decisions. Personal reasons have to do with emotion, while corporate reasons are generally based on value. If the buyer personally dislikes interacting with the individual representing the vendor, he will very rarely buy from that vendor. Buyers want to be helped, and want to develop a trusted relationship with the vendor who can help them. They value demonstrated honesty, integrity and competence. In order to determine and impact the personal motivation for each buyer, you need to build a relationship with each of them. At the very least, you need your Internal Champion to have a strong relationship with each buyer and share their motivations with you.<BR><BR>Typically, personal motivations are driven from the buyer\'s need to be respected within his organization. He wants to \"hitch his wagon\" to a successful project. In most cases, the project driver (typically the LOB Manager) wants to be seen as an instrument of change in his company. He will choose to sign with the vendor who can help him design the right solution for his company, and then help him deliver it. For this, the buyer will receive credit for identifying a good partner to work with, as well as being lauded for a successful implementation. All buyers will have something riding on this project, be it recognition at the right level within the organization, something to add to their resume, or even a promotion. Their focus will be on ensuring the success of the project. You need to have an overview of their career path to date, their ambitions for the future, how they feel about the organization their working in, and how they get on with their peers and their managers. All of these will feed into their personal motivation.<BR><BR>Once you have uncovered the personal motivation, you need to work with each buyer to develop the solution that resolves their major problems.<BR><BR><B>Continue to Pursue?:<\/B> If you are unable to get the right level of interaction to get answers to this question for all the buyers, then the project is at risk. If you don\'t know what their motivations are, then you can\'t help prove to them that you will help them achieve their goals. Use your Internal Champion to try and get answers. Ask your Internal Champion about other projects that this buyer has been involved in. How did he act then? Wqere the projects ultimately successful? How is he viewed within the organization? As you have the names of the buyers, Google them and see if you can determine anything further about them through the references found. All of this may help you get some understanding of their ambitions and you can start to make educated assumptions about their motivations for this project.',
