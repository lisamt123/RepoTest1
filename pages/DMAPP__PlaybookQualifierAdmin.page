					- The problem is the saveSorting method is using the id of the qualifierDiv in the DOM to build the list of qualifierIds to update or delete after a sort
					- When you sort qualifiers very quickly from one stage to another, the PUT requests get queued, but the request parameters (qualifierIds in the changes)
					have the qualifierIds of the qualifiers that were in the DOM when the PUT request was queued
					- If the PUT request get executed after a previous PUT request has changed the qualifiers on that stage, the qualifierIds sent to the backend will be out
					of date
					- A quite convoluted fix could be add an event handler to the queued requests, so their qualifierIds list gets updated after a previous PUT has finished and
					before the next PUT is issued to the backend 
					- NO: It also could be possible to extract the logic that grabs the qualifierIds to a handler that gets executed only before actually sending the PUT to the server
					- The DOM would be in a newer state when grabbing the ids and it wouldn't issue the right request
					- Also check the stop event of the sortable
