<h1 class="appName">Sales Quote Line Items</h1>
<table id="splash" cellspacing="0">

		<td id="splashLeft" width="75%">
		<div class="about">
		<p>With Sales Quote Line Items for AppExchange, you can track
		essential information about your quote process and how it relates to
		opportunities and products in your existing price books. This
		application includes line item discounts which allow the salesperson
		to add discounts from the list price in the price book, without
		changing the list price.</p>
		
		<p>The quote object is related to an opportunity. You can have
		multiple quotes (or versions of quotes) per opportunity in order to
		see quote history. The primary checkbox is used to designate which
		quote will be allowed to update the opportunity amount and opportunity
		line items. You cannot update the opportunity without this flag set.</p>
		
		<p>New quotes can be created from the opportunity, or you can
		clone an existing quote using the provided custom link. This link both
		copies the quote details and sets the quote to the Draft stage.</p>
		<p>Once you create the quote, there are several custom links and
		buttons that you can use to move the quote through the approval
		process and copy the resulting approved quote details back to the
		related opportunity.
		<ul>
			<li>Add Products to Quote: With this custom link, you can search
			and add products en masse to the quote. These products come from the
			pricebook which are set at the Opportunity level. If you haven't
			selected a pricebook, you will be asked to do so at this point.</li>
			
			<li>Edit Line items: This custom link allows a user to edit
			products en masse to adjust discount levels, quantities, service
			date, and line item descriptions.</li>
			
			<li>Copy Quote Items to Opportunity: Once the product
			configuration and discounting is approved, the salesperson can copy
			the quote details into product line items on the opportunity. This
			process will overwrite any previously added product line items so
			that the opportunity now reflects the same details as the approved
			quote and forecasts it appropriately.</li>
			
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>In addition there is a custom link that will create a PDF version of the 
		quote.  This link will create and attach the resulting PDF quote to this quote record.  
		To change the format on this PDF, you may carefully edit the Visualforce page named 
		<a href="/apexpages/setup/listApexPage.apexp" target="_blank">quotePDF</a> </p>
		
		<p>Another feature of this app is the ability to email a version of this quote to a 
		contact. To use this feature, complete a quote and click Send Email, 
		select the template "Simple Quote Template", this is a visualforce template that you can customize.</p>
		
		<p>Further Considerations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Clone button on the header of the quote does not bring
			over the product line items. To do this, click Clone to generate a new copy of the quote, 
			then click copy lines from opportunity to load the line items, these will not have 
			the sales discounts applied from the previous quote.</li>

		</ul>

		<h2 class="exchangeTitle">The AppExchange</h2>
		<p>The AppExchange is the worldâ€™s first on-demand
		application-sharing service. The dozens of pre-built applications and
		components it offers have been created by salesforce.com customers,
		developers, and partners. With these apps, users can do everything
		from managing expenses to tracking purchasing to monitoring
		recruiting. Companies can browse, test drive, and install these apps
		into their salesforce.com accounts with a single click.</p>
		</font>
		<p>Using the AppExchange, organizations can easily add new apps to
		their current salesforce.com deployments, run them alongside their
		existing on-demand applications, and easily customize them to meet
		their unique needs. The breadth of applications on the AppExchange
		including CRM and many other types of business apps is limited
		only by the imagination of its publishers and the on-demand community
		itself.</p>
