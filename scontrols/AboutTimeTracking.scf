						<P></SPAN></SPAN></FONT><!--StartFragment --> Time Tracking for AppExchange helps 
							service organizations keep their businesses running smoothly by enabling them 
							to identify service demand trends and be proactive about contract renewals. The 
							application is designed for companies that sell services in blocks of time that 
							their customers use incrementally.</P>
						<P>Service providers can use the application to keep track of when service 
							contracts are coming up for renewal. Rather than trying to rush through the 
							renewal process without sufficient planning, service organizations can 
							anticipate upcoming renewals and avoid disruptions of service to valuable 
							customers.
						</P>
						<P>Technicians can track the time they work against one or more contracts. 
							Companies that use Supportforce, which is part of the salesforce.com solution, 
							as their customer service and support application can extend its reach with 
							Time Tracking, which provides data about technician availability. Dashboards 
							and reports allow providers to identify trends and predict demand for their 
							services.

								business apps — is limited only by the imagination of its publishers and the 
								on-demand community itself. </FONT>
